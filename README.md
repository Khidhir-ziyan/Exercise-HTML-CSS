# Exercise-HTML-CSS

Welcome to my project repository! In this space, I document my learning journey as I explore the basics of web development, specifically focusing on HTML and CSS.

Through this project, I have gained hands-on experience in creating and styling websites. My understanding of web structure (HTML) and design (CSS) has grown, and I am eager to continue enhancing my skills with more advanced techniques.

What I Learned:
HTML (Hypertext Markup Language): I learned how to structure web pages, including creating elements like headings, paragraphs, lists, images, and links.
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): I gained knowledge in styling web pages, including layout techniques, color schemes, fonts, and responsiveness.

As I continue to develop my web development skills, I will keep improving and updating this project with new concepts and challenges.

Thank you for visiting!
